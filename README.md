# Web Scraping - Mission to Mars

In this assignment, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars that displays the information in a single HTML page.

This project required the use of Python, Beautiful Soup, Splinter/Selenium, HTML/CSS/Bootsrap, and the creation of a MongoDB database where the scraped data would be stored.

The final product displayed:
* An action button that would scrape new data real-time
* The latest news on Mars from NASA
* The Featured Image from JPL Mars Space webpage
* The latest Mars Weather from the official Twitter account
* Mars Facts from Space-Facts.com
* The images of Mars' hemispheres and their title
